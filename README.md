# FractalCompression //PRM 2018
> My second project at the university.
 
The purpose of this project was to write a program that would perform fractal compression of a bitmap image. The program was supposed to take a photo in .bmp format as an input data and compress it into the stream of numbers (much smaller in size) and then decompress it again to .bmp format.
